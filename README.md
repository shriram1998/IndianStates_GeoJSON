# GeoJSON of Indian States

Uploading the json file to use github as the cloud and to reduce the bundle size of my frontend react application.

Please feel free to use the raw file [states_india.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shriram1998/IndianStates_GeoJSON/main/states_india.json) in your application that requires details of Indian states in geoJSON.
